👾 I am actively pursuing:

    🧠 Understanding Deep Learning
    Studying Understanding Deep Learning by Simon J.D. Prince to build a deeper theoretical and intuitive understanding of modern neural networks.

    🚀 Programming Massively Parallel Processors
    Learning GPU programming through Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach by Wen-mei W. Hwu, David B. Kirk, and Izzat El Hajj, focusing on parallel architectures and CUDA.

    ➕ Exploring Algebra and Analysis
    Diving into Topics in Algebra and Analysis by Radmila Bulajich Manfrino, José Antonio Gómez Ortega, and Rogelio Valdez Delgado to strengthen my mathematical foundation.

    🛠️ Building a Server
    Currently designing and implementing a custom server to support my experiments and personal projects.
    
    🔁 Researching Continual Learning
    Investigating continual learning techniques, conducting experiments to identify challenges like catastrophic forgetting, and exploring solutions to enable long-term knowledge retention.
